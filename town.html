        <h1>The fun awaits</h1>
        <p id="p1">
          Jönköping is a small town located in the central southern part of
          Sweden. With population over 90 000 people, you would think the city
          may not have much to offer, but you would be mistaken! With Jönköping
          University being in the center of hte city, over 10 000 students bring
          life to the campus ant to the city itself by hosting parties every
          weekend. <br />
          <br />
          What else can you do here if you are not a student and maybe don't
          like parties? You can always go ice-skating, and it's free! ⛸ Besides
          that, the views are spectacular here, so a bike stroll by the lakeside
          or a cup of coffe overwieving it sounds lik a perfect afternoon,
          doesn't it?

        <h2>Must-visit places in JKPG ✨</h2>
        <p id="p2">
          This gorgeous city offers much more than we expect, and with it there
          are amazing places you have to go and party if you stop by. <br />
          Here are some:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Akademien 🍻</li>
          <li>ID Club 🎶</li>
          <li>Shooters 🎱</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="p2">
          Aka and ID are amazing for parties, but if you want a good bonding
          experience with your friends, then Shooters is the place to go!

        <h3>Come eat a horse 🐴</h3>
        <p id="p3">
          Not really!🤷🏼 We have a lot of good food here, but horses are not on
          the menu! Anyways, if you want a good Kanelbulle (as sweeds would say)
          or a nice dinner, than I would suggest the following.
        </p>
        <p id="p3">My favourite places:</p>
