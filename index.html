        <h1>A brief introduction</h1>
        <p id="p1">
          I am 20 years old and I come from Serbia. My sun sign is ♋️, but I
          relate more to my ascedant and moon sign — ♌️ & ♈️. I have lived in
          Serbia for 20 years and am now liviing and studying in Sweden. New
          Media Design is the program I've chosen, and so far it's going
          amazing! We'll see agter this course tho... 😅 My goals for the next
          five years are to travel as much as possbile, work with something I
          enjoy and spend more time with my friends. Honestly, life is to short
          to want anything else.

          Hobbies are hard to define in the age of capitalism, but here is
          something I like to do even when I'm not paid for it:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Listening to "Everything goes" podcast by Emma Chamberlien 🎧</li>
          <li>Taking photos of my friends, food and places I visit 📸</li>
          <li>I loooove travelling...✈️</li>
          <li>
            Watching TED talks may sound boring, but not if you find the right
            ones!
          </li>
        </ul>
