      <h1>Dance photoshoot with Isidora</h1>
      <p1
        >In an attempt to capture movement, I got one of my friends who does
        dance to perform while I took photos of her. <br />
        <br />
        The idea was to make the movement static but still show that it is
        fluid. The concept captures indivdual statements that our body makes
        while moving to a certain impulse, like a feeling that is going but
        isn't finished.
